      "in los angeles the alcoholic and lazy hank chinaski matt dillon performs a wide range of non qualified functions just to get enough money to drink and gamble in horse races his primary and only objective is writing and having sexy with dirty women factotum is an uninteresting pointless and extremely boring movie about an irresponsible drunken vagrant that works a couple of days or weeks just to get enough money to buy spirits and gamble being immediately fired due to his reckless behavior in accordance with imdb this character would be the fictional alter ego of the author charles bukowski and based on this story i will certainly never read any of his novels honestly if the viewer likes this theme of alcoholic couples better off watching the touching and heartbreaking hector babenco s ironweed or marco ferreri s storie di ordinaria follia that is based on the life of the same writer my vote is four title brazil factotum sem destino factotum without destiny \n",
      "this film is bundled along with gli fumavano le colt lo chiamavano camposanto and both films leave a lot to be desired in the way of their dvd prints first both films are very dark occasionally making it hard to see exactly what s happening second neither film has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed film though il prezzo del potere does seem to have a better dub personally i always prefer subtitles but for the non purists out there this isn t a problem these dvd problems however are not the fault of the original film makers just the indifferent package being marketed four decades later as for the film it s about the assassination of president garfield this is a major problem as van johnson looks about as much like garfield as judy garland in no way whatsoever does he look like garfield he s missing the beard has the wrong hair color and style and is just not even close in any way trust me on this i am an american history teacher and we are paid to know these sort of things the real life garfield was a civil war general and looked like the guys on the smith brothers cough drop boxes plus using some other actor to provide the voice for johnson in the dubbing is just surreal never before or since has van johnson sounded quite so macho he was a fine actor but certainly not a convincing general or macho president in addition to the stupid casting president garfield s death was in no way like this film it s obvious that the film makers are actually cashing in on the crazy speculation about conspiracies concerning the death of jfk not garfield garfield was shot in washington dc not dallas by a lone gunman with severe mental problems not a group of men with rifles however according to most experts what actually killed garfield over two months later were incompetent doctors who probed and probed and probed to retrieve a bullet to no avail and never bothered cleaning their hands or implements in the process in other words like george washington who was basically killed by repeated bloodletting when suffering with pneumonia he died due to malpractice in the movie they got nothing right whatsoever other than indeed president garfield was shot because the film bears almost no similarity to real history it s like a history lesson as taught from someone from another planet or someone with a severe brain injury why not also include ninjas fighting robots and the greek gods while you re at it aside from some decent acting and production values because the script is utter cow crap i don t recommend anyone watch it it s just a complete and utter mess \n",
      "i only comment on really very good films and on utter rubbish my aim is to help people who want to see great films to spend their time and money wisely i also want to stop people wasting their time on garbage and want to publicize the fact that the director producer of these garbage films can t get away with it for very long we will find out who you are and will vote with out feet and wallets this film clearly falls into the garbage category the director and writer is john shiban it s always a bad sign when the writer is also the director maybe he wants two pay cheques he shouldn t get any so remember the name john shiban and if you see anything else by him forget it i won t say anything about the plot others have already i am a little worried by how much the director likes to zoom in to the poor girl s face when she is crying and screaming these long duration shots are a little worrying and may say something about the state of mind of mr shiban maybe he should get psychiatric help enough already it s crap don t waste your time on it \n",
      "when you look at the cover and read stuff about it an entirely different type of movie comes to mind than what you get here then again maybe i read the summary for the other movie called mausolem instead as there were two movies of this title released about the same time with both featuring plots that had key elements in common however reading stuff about that movie here i know i saw this one and not that one and that movie is even less what one would imagine a movie with that title would be about i will be honest i expect more of a zombie type picture and you get that in this movie to some degree however there is more stuff involving the occult and strange powers as the opening scene of the people being taken away by the coroner at the beginning of the film will attest to the movie also has the old theme of kids going somewhere they do not belong to have some crazy party in this case it is in fact a mausoleum the other movie i do not think really has that key feature playing that prominent role in the movie and i see the score for this one is higher too still it was just not the movie i was expecting \n",
      "rollerskating vampires i m sorry but even for the s that s just way too cheesy to be remotely scary you can excuse the original the odd kitsch moment because it was parodying old movies and tv shows but that s been done once so the sequel needed to be a little less camp not even more outlandish plus the first movie had the presence of chris sarandon a man who could even make stalking discotheques in casual knitwear seem seductive that this one sorely lacks so there was no danger in anything that happened it just seemed silly admittedly i only saw this once when i was but by then already being a huge fan of the original i remember being disgusted to me there is no sequel to fright night just a tacky spoof that doesn t deserve any appraisal whatsoever \n",
      "technically abominable with audible pops between scenes and awesomely amateurish flesh requires a lot of patience to sit through and will probably turn off most viewers but the dialogue rings amazingly true and joe dallesandro who exposes his body in almost every scene also gives an utterly convincing performance a curio to be sure but the more polished trash made two years later is a definite step forward i suggest you watch that instead \n",
      "when hollywood is trying to grasp what an intelligent person is like they fail so miserably finding it hard putting words in the mouth of the purported genius right any genius walks around trying to rub in his superiority at every instance sure they hang out in bars and pick fights it s not like they are generalizing wildly autistic nerds who never have a tan plus if you are a genius you know all about math and history and politics and of course you re constantly up to date with current events and a thorough analysis of them coz these things like all go together n stuff y know plus you walk around with a smirk all the time you are just a smug son of a you know what that s how it is y all and of course you smoke like someone who never smoked before but you smoke coz it s like cool n stuff y know and you re different that is understood and of course you can fight you re a bully a bully who finds time to study books whenever he doesn t lift weights and whenever he doesn t smoke or drink beer because he follows a strict health regimen and you date a something college student minnie driver well i won t even comment matt damon team america has hit the nail on the head already this movie is a daydream of a beavis butthead type student in other words of them yeah that s what i would be like if i was a genius but stupid people and stupid authors in this case cannot imagine the lives of geniuses \n",
      "respected western auteur budd boetticher is woefully out of place with this choppy modern day cops and robbers story that suffers from a strong lack of emotional believability boetticher seems to have waived rehearsal time and settled for the first take as leads joe cotton and rhonda fleming put little effort into their roles delivering lines flatly and without energy mild mannered employee leon foggy poole works as an inside man on a bank job that goes bad and gets his wife killed in the process he escapes from prison and immediately sets out to kill the wife of the detective who killed his hundreds of cops are mobilized to keep him from getting to the home of the intended who has been moved to another location but wouldn t you know in the films final moments we have foggy trailing feet behind the victim who thought somehow that taking a bus back to the house was a sound move while a company of cops observe and bicker over what action to take sound preposterous you should see it it s all of that and more lucien ballard s camera work does a decent job of bringing noir to the suburbs but the editing is lackadaisical and shapeless and it drains the film of its suspense and pace as poole wendell corey is the best thing in the film managing to evoke great sympathy as he transitions from gentle soul to murderer these attributes aside killer uniformly fails in construction and execution making its message clear go western old budd \n"
